# whoaThickFrames_Classic-TBC-Anniversary-Fix
A quick fix to get whoaThickFrames running for TBC Anniversary again (from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/whoa-thickframes-for-wow-classic)

It's a quick-and-dirty fix and I'm not the main author.

## How to install

Download the code as zip and put **only the `whoaThickFrames_Classic` folder** in your Addons folder, **NOT** the entire zip's contents!

## What's working

* player, target, focus, target of target, target of focus frames working
* options should be working 
* works with edit mode moving/resizing

## What's not working

* threat indicator probably at least wonky, not tested yet
* probably a lot of small things, especially in weird combinations with some options or other addons

## Support?

Feel free to open an issue here, but I won't promise anything, as I'm hoping smokked_ over at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/whoa-thickframes-for-wow-classic will pick up the addon for TBC officially again!
